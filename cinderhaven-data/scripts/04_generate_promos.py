"""Generate the `promotions` table.

Builds ~80 promotional events across the 157-week window, with retailer mix,
promo type mix, seasonal concentration, and a few line-level promos that span
multiple SKUs in the same product line.

Includes promo_cost (manufacturer's funded amount) and funding_mechanism
(off_invoice, bill_back, scan_down, mcb, fixed_fee, slotting) columns
for integration with the deduction pipeline.
