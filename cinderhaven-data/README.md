Cinderhaven Provisions is a **synthetic demonstration dataset**: a
fictional specialty food brand invented for the
[Lailara portfolio](https://github.com/MsShawnP). It is not a real
company, not a client, and not any real company's data — every row
is generated. The scenario: a brand doing $32.5M in trailing-52-week
scan revenue across 50 SKUs in five product lines (Artisan Sauces,
Pantry Staples, Specialty Condiments, Dried Goods, Snack Bites),
selling through six retailers — Walmart, Costco, Whole Foods,
Sprouts, Kroger, and a regional group — across 640 doors. The cost
table also carries rate-card columns for UNFI, KeHE, and DTC, but
the scan and deduction history covers the six retailers.

## The dataset

**`data/cinderhaven_product_master.db`** — a 102 MB SQLite database,
21 tables, committed directly. No build step.

The deduction and dispute layers pose the scenario the
[trade-spend diagnostic](https://github.com/MsShawnP/trade-spend-data-diagnostic)
is built to detect: roughly $343K/year of operational waste spread
almost evenly across eight deduction categories, a dispute function
that wins 41.9 cents per disputed dollar but touches less than a
third of the waste, and a promotion calendar that stops in November
2024 while promo billbacks keep arriving through the end of 2025.

## Headline figures (verified against this snapshot)

- Trailing-52-week scan revenue (2025-01-04 to 2025-12-27):
  **$32,472,742**
- Structural trade: **$2,992,224 (9.2%)** by the workbook's
  channel-average method; a pure-SQL channel-mapping variant gives
  $2,914,207 (9.0%) — both derivations are documented in the
  diagnostic's `DEFENSIBILITY.md`
- Operational waste (trailing 365 days, excluding promo billbacks):
  **$343,281 across 4,772 events (1.1%)**; all-in trade **10.3%**
- Waste categories: 8, six of them clustered between $48,861 and
  $53,664; the largest is 15.6% of the total
- Promo billbacks with no matching calendar promotion: **521 /
  $50,055** over three years; 513 of 540 trailing-year billbacks
  ($49,315) are unmatched
- Double-dip deductions: **0**; vague deductions: **0**
- Disputes: **5,247** (won 1,411, partial 1,478, lost 1,509,
  pending 849); **$160,161 recovered on $382,579 disputed = 41.9%**
  (49.7% on closed disputes)

## How this snapshot was produced

The database was exported from the cinderhaven-data-platform
Postgres instance and patched for local use by two scripts in the
trade-spend-data-diagnostic repo: `scripts/extract_from_postgres.py`
(pulls all 21 tables over a `flyctl proxy`) and
`scripts/fixup_extracted_db.py` (adds the compatibility columns the
workbook expects, e.g. plain retailer names alongside `RET-*` ids).

The generators in this repo's `scripts/01-15` are the pre-platform
pipeline. They produce a different, older dataset (90 SKUs, 2024
windows) and remain only as reference; `data_generation_log.md`
documents that pipeline, not the current database.
