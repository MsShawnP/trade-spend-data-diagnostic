-- Question: What is the all-in trade rate (structural +
--           operational waste) as a percentage of revenue?
-- Tables:   scan_data, stores, sku_costs, deductions
-- Output:   total_revenue, structural_trade, operational_waste,
--           all_in_trade, structural_rate, waste_rate, all_in_rate
-- Params:   :oldest_week — 52nd-most-recent distinct week_ending
--           :max_scan — most recent week_ending (for deduction
--           trailing-365 window)
-- Notes:    Gap query — was Python arithmetic combining three
--           separate query results. Locked numbers: revenue
--           $27,483,467, structural $5,207,524 (18.9%), waste
--           $1,967,416 (7.2%), all-in 26.1%.
