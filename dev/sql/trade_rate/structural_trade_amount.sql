-- Question: What is the total structural (planned) trade spend
--           in dollars, broken out by retailer?
-- Tables:   scan_data, stores, sku_costs
-- Output:   retailer, channel_revenue, trade_rate, structural_trade_dollars
-- Params:   :oldest_week — the 52nd-most-recent distinct
--           week_ending from trailing_52_weeks.sql
-- Notes:    Gap query — this calculation was done in Python by
--           pairing revenue_by_retailer results with channel
--           trade rates. This query does it in pure SQL.
--           Locked number: total structural trade = $4,435,052.
--           Channel mapping: Walmart, Costco, Whole Foods, UNFI,
--           DTC each have their own rate column; all other
--           retailers use trade_spend_pct_regional.
