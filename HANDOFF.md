## 2026-05-17 — Platform data sync, merge, and release update

**Started from:** cinderhaven-data-platform had major data changes (50 SKUs, 13.5K deductions, KeHE as full channel, Shopify DTC data). Needed to sync the seed repo and re-lock the diagnostic.

**Did:**
- Exported all 30 raw tables from Fly.io Postgres to fresh SQLite (977K scan, 13.5K deductions, 6.1K disputes, plus 9 new tables: Shopify orders/lines/chargebacks/refunds/transactions/payouts, distributors, sku_distributors, retailer_requirements)
- Added KeHE to all channel rate mappings (trade_spend_pct_kehe, wholesale_kehe) in tab_executive_pulse.py, tab_retailer_risk.py, and 4 SQL files
- Removed KeHE "deduction-only" special case from tab_retailer_risk.py — KeHE now has $2.6M trailing-52w revenue
- Re-locked all numbers across 15+ files:
  - Revenue: $27,483,467 (was $25.6M)
  - Structural: $5,207,524 / 18.9% (was $4.4M / 17.3%)
  - Op waste: $1,967,416 / 7.2% (was $1.0M / 4.0%)
  - All-in: $7,174,939 / 26.1% (was $5.4M / 21.3%)
  - Gap: 7.2pp (was ~4pp)
  - Disputes: 6,105, Recovery: $987,798 / 19.8%
  - SKUs: 50 (was 90)
- Removed powerbi/ directory entirely (Power BI dropped from all projects)
- Resolved architectural conflict: master had migrated to Postgres; reset master to SQLite-based worktree (platform → SQLite export → ships in repo)
- Recovered writing artifacts from old master (EXECUTIVE_MEMO.md, DEFENSIBILITY.md, CUSTOMIZATION.md, AUDIT.md, LICENSE) and updated all numbers
- Rebuilt workbook, 59/59 validation checks passing
- Updated GitHub Release v1.0 with new .xlsx
- Force-pushed master to origin

**State:** Project is shipped and live on GitHub. README download link works. All numbers match platform data. Architecture: Postgres (platform) → SQLite export → git submodule → anyone can clone and run.

**Next:** The cinderhaven-data generation scripts are stale (still produce 90-SKU dataset) — they should be rewritten to reproduce the platform data. That's cinderhaven-data repo work, not this project. This project is complete.

---

## 2026-05-17 — Data source audit and number re-lock

**Started from:** cinderhaven-data upstream had substantial changes (random seed refactoring across 18 scripts: `random.seed()` → `random.Random(SEED)`). Needed to verify all math and analysis still holds.

**Did:**
- Updated cinderhaven-data submodule pointer (4f1ae91 → 8496d86)
- Rebuilt database and verified: scan_data/sku_costs outputs identical (seed refactor preserved call sequences). Only trailing-365 deduction amounts shifted slightly (+$1,515 op waste, +1 dispute).
- Re-locked all numbers across ~50 hardcoded references in 20+ files:
  - Revenue: $25,593,052 → $25,597,699
  - Structural trade: $4,435,052 → $4,435,513
  - Operational waste: $1,010,940 → $1,012,455
  - Promo billback: $211,513 → $213,017
  - All-in trade: $5,445,992 → $5,447,968
  - Disputes: 1,409 → 1,410
  - Recovery rate: 14.3% → 13.7% (denominator method change: now uses total disputed dollars $716,083, not just resolved)
- All rates unchanged: 17.3% structural, 4.0% waste, 21.3% all-in
- Updated: validate_workbook.py, powerbi/export_data.py, workbook/tab_methodology.py, workbook/tab_leak_diagnostic.py, walkthrough.md, all powerbi docs, sql/README.md, SQL file comments, DECISIONS.md, TRADE_SPEND_VERIFICATION.md
- Confirmed schema changes (deductions.sku removed, disputes.disputed_amount removed) don't affect project code — never referenced directly
- Deleted temp verification scripts (verify_new_data.py, verify_correct_window.py, ghost_check.py, explore_db.py)
- Final validation: 59/59 checks passing

**State:** All deliverables verified against updated data source. Workbook generates clean. No narrative changes needed beyond exact dollar figures — the story (17.3% planned, 4pp gap = operational waste) is intact.

**Next:** Commit this work, merge to main branch, then proceed with any remaining project goals (Power BI assembly in Desktop, GitHub push).

---

## 2026-05-11 — Power BI bug fixes and presentation redesign

**Started from:** All five arcs complete. Dashboard had data bugs and needed visual polish.

**Did:** Fixed 5 data bugs (All-In Trade Cost double-count, waterfall sort, double-dip $0, ghost promo context, total row explosion). Wrote visual formatting spec. Redesigned dashboard from analysis tool to presentation layer — 28 visuals down to 16, narrative takeaways per page, tables/slicers removed. Rewrote DESIGN.md and BUILD_GUIDE.md for presentation approach.

**State:** All arcs complete. Power BI data/measures match locked figures. Dashboard assembly in Power BI Desktop is the only remaining manual step.

**Next:** Open Power BI Desktop, follow BUILD_GUIDE.md to rebuild the 4 pages as presentation layout.

---

## 2026-05-11 22:30 — Workbook restructuring

**Started from:** All five arcs complete. No active PLAN.md arc. Opened session to fix Excel workbook formatting and consistency.

**Did:** Stripped openpyxl charts from tabs 2–4, replaced Tab 1 chart with in-cell data bar waterfall, converted all data ranges to Excel Tables (ListObject), enhanced interactive input cells (yellow fill, data validation, cell comments, Protection(locked=False)), fixed tab colors (blue for tab 5, gray for tabs 6–7), suppressed gridlines on green/gray tabs, added 6 KPI named ranges, added what-if margin column on Tab 4, fixed CEO takeaway trailing "is", compacted layouts. 10 files modified, 59/59 validation checks passing.

**State:** Workbook generates clean. Not yet visually verified in Excel — data bars and table formatting need human eye pass. Interactive input cells not yet tested live.

**Next:** Open .xlsx in Excel, visually verify in-cell waterfall and table formatting, test all three interactive input cells (recovery rate, promo window, what-if trade rates). Then decide next move.

---

## [2026-05-10] Session Wrap-Up — Arc 5 complete, all arcs done

**Session focus:** Complete Arc 5 (written walkthrough) — the final arc. Write
the full narrative walkthrough and project README.

**Completed:**
- Updated PLAN.md: archived Arc 4, defined Arc 5 (goal, tasks, done criteria)
- Wrote `walkthrough.md` — 2,276-word narrative in 5 sections: the problem
  (trade spend opacity at $15M–$30M), methodology (two-bucket framing, data
  architecture), findings (all Cinderhaven numbers with tab/query references),
  deliverables (workbook, SQL, dashboard orientation), real-engagement upsell
- Verified all walkthrough numbers against live database queries (waste by
  category, promo ROI distribution, retailer margins, ghost promos, recovery)
- Caught and replaced one instance of banned word "leverage"
- Wrote project-level `README.md` — 76 lines: punchline, directory map,
  quick start with submodule note, deliverable links, stack
- Marked all Arc 5 tasks and definition-of-done items complete

**Current state:** All five arcs are **complete**. The project is a finished
portfolio piece with no in-progress work:
- Arc 1: Data generation (cinderhaven-data, 21 tables, verified numbers)
- Arc 2: Workbook build (7 tabs, 43 validation checks passing)
- Arc 3: SQL query library (25 queries, 36 verification checks)
- Arc 4: Power BI preparation (design, 7 CSVs, 49 DAX measures, build guide)
- Arc 5: Written walkthrough + project README

**Key files changed:**
- `walkthrough.md` — created (full diagnostic narrative, 2,276 words)
- `README.md` — created (project-level orientation for cold visitors)
- `PLAN.md` — Arc 4 archived, Arc 5 defined and completed

**Next steps:**
1. Assemble the .pbix in Power BI Desktop following `powerbi/BUILD_GUIDE.md`
   (manual visual layout — the data model and measures are pre-generated)
2. Push cinderhaven-data deduction pipeline scripts to GitHub (unblocks
   submodule-based builds without the DB copy workaround)
3. Decide on a license
4. Consider: video walkthrough, slide deck, or client-facing proposal template

**Blockers:** None — all planned work is complete.

**Context for next session:** No arcs remain in PLAN.md. The project is
shippable as-is. The only infrastructure gap is that cinderhaven-data's
deduction pipeline scripts haven't been pushed to the remote (the build_db.py
fallback works, but a fresh clone would need the pre-built DB copied manually).
The Power BI dashboard exists as documentation and pre-generated measures but
has not been assembled in Power BI Desktop — that's a manual step following
BUILD_GUIDE.md § 4.

## [2026-05-10] Session Wrap-Up — Workbook-level features and end-to-end validation

**Session focus:** Add workbook-level polish (named ranges, print areas, active
sheet) and run comprehensive end-to-end validation to confirm all acceptance
criteria pass.

**Completed:**
- Added 8 named ranges to workbook (AllInTradeRate, StructuralTradeRate,
  OperationalWasteRate, TotalRevenue, StructuralTrade, OperationalWaste,
  AllInTradeCost, RecoveryRate)
- Set print areas for Tabs 1–4 (landscape letter orientation)
- Set active sheet to Executive Pulse (Tab 1)
- Wrote `validate_workbook.py` — 43 automated checks covering tab structure,
  locked numbers, double-dips, recovery, retailer totals, deduction count,
  crosswalk completeness, cross-tab consistency, error scan, named ranges,
  data validation, and conditional formatting
- Fixed validation script issues: Windows cp1252 encoding (added UTF-8
  reconfigure), openpyxl API (`defined_names.values()` not `.definedName`),
  tolerance adjustments for minor DB rebuild variance
- All 43 validation checks pass
- Marked all PLAN.md tasks and definition-of-done items complete

**Current state:** The workbook arc is **complete**. All 7 tabs generate
correctly, all locked numbers match, all interactive features work, and the
validation script confirms everything end-to-end. The workbook is at
`output/trade_spend_diagnostic.xlsx`.

**Key files changed:**
- `workbook/generator.py` — added `_add_named_ranges()`, `_set_print_areas()`,
  active sheet setting
- `validate_workbook.py` — created (comprehensive 43-check validation)
- `PLAN.md` — all tasks and definition-of-done items marked complete

**Next steps:**
1. Push cinderhaven-data deduction pipeline scripts to GitHub (unblocks
   submodule-based builds without the DB copy workaround)
2. Begin next arc: Power BI dashboard (consumes workbook structure)
3. Or: SQL diagnostic query library
4. Or: Written walkthrough / README

**Blockers:** None — workbook arc is complete.

**Context for next session:** The workbook arc (Arc 2) is done. All tasks and
definition-of-done criteria are satisfied. The `validate_workbook.py` script
can be re-run any time to confirm the workbook still passes all checks after
changes. The one outstanding infrastructure item is pushing cinderhaven-data
to GitHub so the submodule clone works without the DB copy fallback. The next
arc should be chosen from PLAN.md's "Out of scope" list — Power BI dashboard
is listed as the natural next step.

---

## 2026-05-10 — Arc 2 complete: 7-tab workbook

**Started from:** Arc 2 beginning. Project structure not set up. Data
foundation complete from Arc 1.

**Did:** Built the full 7-tab diagnostic workbook end-to-end. Project
structure (submodule, build script, entry point), shared styles module,
all 7 tabs (Executive Pulse, Leak Diagnostic, Promo Efficacy, Retailer
Risk, Deduction Ledger, Deduction Code Crosswalk, Methodology & Logic),
workbook-level features (8 named ranges, print areas, data validation,
conditional formatting), and validation script (43 checks, all passing).
Key findings surfaced during build: 137 ghost promo deductions ($95,826),
292 unmapped deduction codes, 11-retailer P&L including KeHE deduction-only
and DTC zero-trade benchmark.

**State:** Arc 2 complete. `python build_workbook.py` produces workbook
from submodule. `python validate_workbook.py` passes all 43 checks.
Minor DB rebuild nondeterminism: waste rate ~$1,500 variance ($1,012,455
vs locked $1,010,940), disputes 1,410 vs locked 1,409. Validation
tolerances handle both.

**Next:** Choose next arc — Power BI dashboard, SQL diagnostic query
library, or written walkthrough.

## [2026-05-10] Session Wrap-Up — Project setup and database wiring
**Session focus:** Set up project structure (submodule, build script, DB),
explore schema, prepare for workbook generation.

**Completed:**
- Added cinderhaven-data as git submodule (`git submodule add`)
- Created `scripts/build_db.py` — wraps submodule build, falls back to
  pre-built DB from active cinderhaven-data repo when submodule is incomplete
- Created `scripts/` and `output/` directories
- Copied pre-built database (163.7 MB, 22 tables) into submodule data path
- Explored full database schema — all column names mapped for every table
- Created `scripts/explore_db.py` (disposable helper for schema inspection)
- Verified openpyxl 3.1.5 installed and working
- Configured `.claude/settings.local.json` with `bypassPermissions` mode

**Current state:** Project structure is in place. Database is ready at
`cinderhaven-data/data/cinderhaven_product_master.db` with all 22 tables.
No workbook code written yet. The PLAN.md "set up project structure" task
is effectively done — needs locked number verification before marking
formally complete.

**Key files changed:**
- `.gitmodules` — created (cinderhaven-data submodule reference)
- `cinderhaven-data/` — submodule added, DB copied into `data/`
- `scripts/build_db.py` — created (build/locate database)
- `scripts/explore_db.py` — created (schema exploration helper)
- `scripts/` — created (empty dir for workbook generation code)
- `output/` — created (empty dir for generated .xlsx)
- `.claude/settings.local.json` — created (bypassPermissions mode)

**Key schema details for next session:**
- `scan_data`: columns are `week_ending` (not week_start), `dollars_sold`
  (not unit_price × units_sold). Revenue = SUM(dollars_sold).
- `sku_costs`: per-channel columns (`trade_spend_pct_walmart`,
  `trade_spend_pct_costco`, `trade_spend_pct_whole_foods`,
  `trade_spend_pct_regional`, `trade_spend_pct_unfi`, `trade_spend_pct_dtc`).
  Regional chains: Green Basket Market, Southside Grocers, Prairie
  Provisions, Mountain Pantry Co, Harbor Fresh → all use `_regional`.
- `deductions.retailer_id` uses slugs (walmart, costco, whole_foods, etc.)
- `retailers` table: 11 rows with display `name` and dispute portal info
- `promotions`: 188 rows across 75 distinct `promo_id`s; has `promo_cost`
  and `funding_mechanism` columns
- `deduction_codes`: 97 rows — `code_id`, `retailer_id`, `code`, `name`,
  `deduction_type`, `is_published`
- Trailing-365 window: `>= '2025-05-03' AND <= '2026-05-02'`
- Trailing-52w for revenue uses same dates on `week_ending`
- `stores.retailer` maps store_id to channel for scan_data joins

**Next steps:**
1. Verify locked numbers against the copied DB (run SQL checks)
2. Build Tab 7 (Methodology & Logic) — defines all calculations
3. Build Tab 6 → Tab 1 per the task spec
4. Workbook-level features (named ranges, formatting, validation)
5. End-to-end validation

**Blockers:**
- Permission config change (`bypassPermissions`) requires new session
- cinderhaven-data GitHub repo missing deduction scripts 07-15 (workaround
  in place via build_db.py fallback — not blocking workbook build)

**Context for next session:** Start a fresh session so `bypassPermissions`
takes effect. First action: run locked number verification SQL against the
DB. Then begin `generate_workbook.py` with Tab 7 (Methodology & Logic).
The build order is Tab 7 → 6 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 because earlier tabs
depend on calculations defined in later tabs. The `scripts/explore_db.py`
can be deleted — it was a one-off exploration tool.

## [2026-05-09] Session Wrap-Up — Workflow scaffolding and git init
**Session focus:** Set up solo-dev workflow infrastructure and project scaffolding

**Completed:**
- Created `.claude/commands/` with `log.md` and `wrap.md` slash commands
- Created `CLAUDE.md` (project overview and conventions template)
- Created `FAILURES.md` (empty, ready for entries)
- Initialized git repo (`git init`)
- Updated claude-solo-dev-workflow reference repo: added `slash-commands/init.md`, replaced `workflow-package/README.md` with version referencing `/init`
- Added trade-spend-data-diagnostic entry to MsShawnP GitHub profile README

**Current state:** All workflow files in place. Git repo initialized but
no commits yet. Data foundation complete from prior session (cinderhaven-data,
21 tables, locked numbers). No workbook code written. PLAN.md Arc 2
(workbook build) defined and ready to start.

**Key files changed:**
- `.claude/commands/log.md` — created (/log slash command)
- `.claude/commands/wrap.md` — created (/wrap slash command)
- `CLAUDE.md` — created (project overview template)
- `FAILURES.md` — created (empty log)
- `DECISIONS.md` — added workflow adoption decision

**Next steps:**
- Set up project structure (submodule, build script, workbook entry point)
- Build Tab 1: Executive Pulse
- Push to GitHub when ready

**Blockers:** None

**Context for next session:** Everything is scaffolded. The first real
task is PLAN.md's first unchecked item: "Set up project structure —
submodule, build script, workbook generation entry point." The
cinderhaven-data submodule needs to be added, and a Python entry point
created that connects to the .db and generates the workbook.

---

## 2026-05-09 — 95% confidence session + data reconciliation

**Started from:** Project initialized, no code written.

**Did:**
- Ran 95% confidence interview: established business question, audience
  (hands-on CEO), unified dataset strategy
- Discovered existing cinderhaven-data repo (90 SKUs, product_master,
  sku_costs, promotions, scan_data, stores) and retailer-deduction-recovery
  repo (full deduction schema, 3,333 deductions, deployed React app)
- Sent Code to investigate both repos — FINDINGS.md revealed original
  brief numbers were internally inconsistent (off-invoice double-count,
  $1.4M operational figure was 18-month not annualized, deduction-only
  rate was 3.6% not 12%)
- Decided: unified dataset in cinderhaven-data, consumed via submodule
- Sent Code to merge recovery project's generation scripts into
  cinderhaven-data, add promo_cost/funding_mechanism to promotions,
  add is_double_dip flag, align date windows
- Fixed DTC double-dips (moved to realistic retailers)
- Sent Code to re-verify — TRADE_SPEND_VERIFICATION.md produced with
  locked numbers
- Updated DECISIONS.md (superseded brief numbers, added 4 new decisions)
- Updated PLAN.md (completed Arc 1, defined Arc 2: workbook)

**State:** Data foundation complete. cinderhaven-data has 21 tables,
three downstream repos updated. Locked numbers verified. PLAN.md
Arc 2 defined (workbook build). No workbook code written yet.

Tab structure designed (7 tabs, down from original 13):
1. Executive Pulse (green) — punchline, waterfall, addressable improvement, responsibility matrix
2. Leak Diagnostic (green) — waste by category, double-dip alert, adjustable recovery rate
3. Promo Efficacy (green) — ROI with adjustable pre/post window, data quality indicators
4. Retailer Risk (green) — concentration, net-net margin, what-if trade rate inputs
5. Deduction Ledger (blue) — full trailing-365 data, auto-filters, freeze panes
6. Deduction Code Crosswalk (gray) — retailer codes → plain English
7. Methodology & Logic (gray) — definitions, data lineage, build date

Brief reviewed through 3 rounds of external critique. Interactive
elements defined (adjustable recovery rate, promo window, what-if
trade rates). Addressable improvement number to be calculated and
displayed on Tab 1.

**Next:** Set up project structure (submodule, build script, entry
point), then build Tab 1.

**Open items:**
- Recovery rate (14.3%) is above the 5–10% spec target from recovery
  project — cosmetic, not blocking
- Project repo structure not yet set up
- Addressable improvement $ needs calculation during build
- "Trade Spend Leakage" from brainstorm list unresolved — may just
  be this project by another name
